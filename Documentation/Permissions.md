# Permissions

With BombasticProjectiles, we want users to have silly fun while providing excellent reassurance for server-safety.

Permissions DO NOT override Feature-Toggles.
> - Features will work if Require-Permissions is set to False.
> - If set to True then Permissions and Features for said feature must both be granted/enabled.
